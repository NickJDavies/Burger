Server to display burgers that you can add and eat, using sequelize express and (not) handlebars

I spent ages trying to get the handlebars to work but sadly I dont have enough time to properly get it to work so heres the psuedocode as the asignment said to include ::
1. make the index.handlebar and burger handlebar
2. burger handlebar will include the layout for a single burger, which will include the {{each}} method to make it work for all the burgers when I pass them all through at once.
3. the index handlebar will be the layout of the full page, with the section for the burgers.

given more time I would also make a delete function to either clear all burgers or to delete singular burgers.
